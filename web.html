    <img src="started.jpg">
    <p>Coding has been tiring soo far it involved a lot of learning sometimes using freecode camp is boring because they repeat the same thing over and over again and sir who has always been meticulous about how often we should  be learnig also have as some hosting to do which i used github a hosting of which was introduced to me by a friend.This journey has not been easy sometimes you will be tired and you will still have to be consistent .I embarked on a journey to become a web developer, and FreeCodeCamp (FCC) was my guiding light. With its comprehensive curriculum and supportive community, FCC helped me navigate the complexities of coding. In this article, I'll share my experiences, challenges, and triumphs on the path to becoming a web developer.When I first started FCC, I felt overwhelmed by the sheer amount of information. The initial HTML/CSS challenges seemed daunting, and I doubted my ability to grasp the concepts. However, I persisted, fueled by my determination to learn. Understanding HTML/CSS: As I progressed through the challenges, I began to comprehend the basics of web development. The interactive coding environment and detailed explanations helped solidify my understanding.

        <h2>CHALLENGES OVERCOMED</h2>
         JavaScript Revelations: FCC's JavaScript section was a game-changer. I finally grasped the concepts of variables, functions, and object-oriented programming.</p>
    </p>Project-Based Learning: Building projects, such as the Tribute Page and Personal Portfolio, helped me apply theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios.This has been my breakthrough thoughout this journey, I overcame certain challenges during this jouneysuch
